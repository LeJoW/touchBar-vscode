# touchBar-vscode README

I was searching a way to navigate between openned files with the touchbar rather than navigate in history. As I found nothing, I created this extension with only navigate editor and block comment.

## Features

This tool has just three commands (built-in, so there is nothing in `src/extension.ts`)&nbsp;:

-   `editor.action.blockComment`, to toggle block comments
-   `workbench.action.previousEditor`, to navigate left
-   `workbench.action.nextEditor`, to navigate right

**Enjoy!**
